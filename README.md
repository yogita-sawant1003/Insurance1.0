Autocare-Assurance-For-Insurance-Companies
This project aims to ensure proper vehicle maintenance to help customers avail of lower insurance premiums. It integrates a Solidity smart contract, a machine learning model, and a frontend application to provide a complete solution for vehicle health tracking and insurance premium calculation.

Project Structure
Solidity Smart Contract - This smart contract fetches vehicle health parameters from a Chainlink oracle and calculates insurance premiums based on the engine health. Smart contract deployed on Remix.
Models - This folder contains all ML models required to build this project
InputFiles- These files are used for uploading them on lighthouse
Solidity_contract- Smart contract to store on blockchain.
static-Stores all files like JS and images
